# lanman
Technical test for Lanman 

Run this project on your local server with php installed.

The project is located in the lanman folder so in order to work the path should be localhost/lanman/index.php

The project uses php, js, jquery. Since some libraries are linked from cnd be sure that your connection is working.

The project is a simple checkout page created with the help of bootstrap, as a feed I chose to create a json containing 
the items with which I will populate the cart, I created a select containing all the input required, through that will 
be possible to change the various inputs that will update the items in the cart. Inputs will be sent to the page in charge of generating the 
receipt based on the taxation and rounding rules imposed in the document.
